# DSA2Project2

this is the read me file for project two of the DSA2
the purpose of this program is to simulate a queuing sytem given different parameters that influence
the statistical data of a queuing system such as the average time waited, percent idle time, and other statistical
data points that are required to be simulated and found in the project description
The program runs by itself and just needs to be put into a linux environment and stored together
use the command "make main" to create the objects for execution and "./main" to run the program and see the results in the terminal
The program uses a min heap queue as a scheduler and a fifo queue as a stand in for a "line" for "customer" or "events" to wait
To summarize the important steps for user interaction with this program are as follows

step 1: Load this folder into a linux environment
step 2: Navigating into the directory with the terminal once inside you can run the "make main" command to generate the executables for the program to run
step 3: simply type into the terminal "./main" to run the program, this is a hands off program that only requires you to start it as it will finsh on its own
step 4: compare simulation results to mathematical results found through statistical models
